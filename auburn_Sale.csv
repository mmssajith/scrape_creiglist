ProCal Liquid Calcium takes the soluble calcium from limestone and isolates it in a liquid form. ProCal OR Advance cal Liquid Calcium begin raises soil pH within a hours and maintains the pH , but without all the hassle and impurities of ag lime. ProCal Calcium is saving up to 50% of the cost ag lime and liquid Calcium has a 2 year soil life. Cheaper and more effective than ag lime or “SuperLime”

Ortho liquid fertilizer are pharmaceutical safe for livestock. They go to work in 2 hour and don't have to wait for rain to get them started. They are formulated for foliar and soil application. By applying foiiar you don't have the leach and waste. All our fertilizes are BIO-BOOSTED . with amino acids, Pre-Biotics, carbon energy, Humic acid , root growth stimulate and trace minerals. '
A 30 years study by Michigan State University proved only 20% of granular fertilizers every made it into the plant while 95% of liquid fertilizers made it into the plant.  2 gal Liquid is equal to 100 lbs granular. (Michigan State Univ.)
3gal ProCal Plus 15 gal of water per acre will change your soil pH and raise calcium saturation levels. 
“I put 3 gallons of Pro-Cal on my 100 acre field. The pH was at 5.5 before I sprayed, and I just re-tested and the pH is at a 6.7. Now I need to treat everything else.” – G. Gates 2019 

“My neighbor used you guys. His fields look better than everyone else’s. One guy asked him why that was, and he said he used your products. That’s why I bought some.” 2019

Liquid Calcium has been studied and proven by nine land grant universities that back the effectiveness of liquid calcium in fixing soil conditions and improving growth. AgriTec is a family-owned company since 1976 and has helped thousands of farmers around the country over the years, save money on lime, and raise  soil pH.
John M  2019, well Procal did what you said it would, I had no weeds in my oats. I usually have to use herbicide this year I didn’t . It was a very clean harvest.

Be careful of over application OF CALCIUM NITRATE! ProCal and Advance cal are not calcium nitrates because, nitrate poisoning can occur as the result of eating crops such as Brassicas, green cereals or sweet clover that contain high levels of nitrate. However, the most common source is inorganic nitrate fertilizer, either directly, via grazing an over-fertilized field, or via water run-off from heavily fertilized fields. Spring is the most common season for nitrate poisoning.

Nitrate poisoning occurs because the nitrate is broken down to nitrite in the rumen. In normal circumstances this nitrite is further broken down to ammonia in the rumen and is then used by the rumen microbes to make protein. However, when large amounts of nitrate are eaten over a short period of time, the nitrite accumulates in the rumen and is absorbed. Once in the bloodstream it reacts with iron in the red blood cells so that they can no longer bind oxygen.

Be cautious of calcium nitrates, as they causes burning and poisoning that results in death to livestock. Bio-Active Liquid by AgriTec calcium WILL NOT burn and is safe for consumption by livestock. Nitrite Poisoning of Livestock Note Number: AG0701Published: February 2002 Updated: July 2008 

Nitrate accumulation in plants is a potential danger to grazing animals. It can cause two different disorders - nitrate poisoning and nitrite poisoning. Nitrates may cause inflammation of the gut when eaten in large quantities, but their main importance is as a source of nitrite. Nitrites cause respiratory distress due to interference with oxygenation of blood; death may follow. Pigs are the species most susceptible to nitrite poisoning, followed by cattle, sheep and horses.
DON'T BE FOOLED BY IMITATIONS! only Advance Cal or ProCal BioLiquid Calcium are NOT CALCIUM NITRATE! Of all “liquid limes’, and other liquid calcium’s. 

Advanced Cal or ProCal BioLiquid Calcium have been proven to positively effect pH, cheaper and faster than lime or calcium nitrate. Calcium Nitrate has a tenancy to burn the plant if over applied and can be a health hazard to live stock. Three years ago, Agritec was approached to market calcium nitrate, but we declined due to the fact we could not find field studies, or University research, that showed calcium Nitrate effecting pH. According to University studies,

What just a few of AgriTec's customers are saying:
""Our wheat rye oats and millet program have proven to deliver a 22% to 40 % increase in bushels per acre with Bio-Activator and Calcium program. It also inhibits fungus, mildew, leaf rust, spot block, root rot... ""

Ortho Liquid Fertilizers 
“I bought Pro Cal last year and 3-18-18 a month ago. You can really see a difference in my fields especially my West field. Last year weeds were taking over now the grass is taking over the weeds without use of herbicides. Something in your products are really helping. I’m going to try some Adv Cal this year to push the growth even more.” Eric , 2020

“I used Adv-cal and 3-18-18 on my pastures last year and this year and this is the greenest ive ever seen my fields look. The year before my yield dropped from 300 bails to 98 due to the dry summer  and your products got it back up in the 300’s. I even have a board horse that will never eat first cutting but he loves the first cutting this year. One happy camper!!”  Susan Olef  2021 

Rob, I am calling about getting tote next, I have never had hay production like I am having. My 3rd cutting is more hay that the 1st and 2nd and they were the best I have ever had. What is amazing about this is this is the driest summer we have had in 3 years and yet you could not tell it by my hay production. I only put one application of 24-0-0-4 about 400 lb per acre in May.  I also applied 3 gal of Advance cal per acre. William S NC 2019

I am happy with the results of Advance Cal and 10/20/10 liquid products and will be ordering more in the future. Chris j  2021

Rob, I really saw a great difference in my hay and fields. It was amazing I applied 3 gal ProCal and 4 gal Nitromaxx and am very pleased with the results. Jim Anderson  2020 

My horse customer can’t say enough good things about my hay that I used the NitroMaxx and ProCal. It is so green the horses just love it. I sold out this year. One field that I could treat looks bad and the hay wasn’t as good. I am reordering for all my fields.  Brent Heller 
 2020

""This is the greenest I have ever seen my corn! The calcium is working great and I need to order more of the Nitro-Maxx."" - Mark Zeimet 2020 I

"" I used 10-20-10 and Adv-cal on my Corn ground and even with the little rain we got this year m fields look great "" Keith Jones  2020

“We need more Nitro-Maxx. We are planting some more corn, and what we already planted and applied Nitro-Maxx on is already chest high. It is looking great.” R.A.  2021

We have not taken post treatment soil samples yet but I can say with 100% assurance, we never has food plots like we did this year and it has made leaps and bounds of difference. Our beans were sick and we added some liquid fertilizer and foliar act and they pulled out of it and ended up with better beans than we have ever had in those particular fields…..We will be using a lot more products this coming season! Andy Abhold Biologist/owner  2021

""We saved over 50% on the cost of fertilizers on our crops by using Liquid calcium."" - Nebraska Farmer
Bio-Liquid Calcium is less expensive by lime, sometimes being half the cost. Is university backed, and used by over 10,000 thousand  farms national every year. 

AgriTec's liquid fertilizers are easy to apply using standard spray equipment.  As can be see from the above computations, 6 gallons of Agrite’s Ortho Liquid Plant Food would provide as much nutrition to the plant as 300 pounds of a dry fertilizer. Actual expense figures usually show Agritec’s Plant Foods saving from 15 to 30% over dry fertilizer costs per acre. So, why buy what you can’t use or might lose? Buy the best and save the most with Agritec’s Plant Foods. For specific recommendations and pricing contact Agritec 800-750-1570

4.5 times more nutrients will be available to the plant using 100 l bs of the liquid than 100 lbs of the same analysis in a dry fertilizer material.

* Radioactive research conducted by Dr. Tukey and Dr. Whitwer at Michigan State University.
Dr. H. B. Tukey, who was the head of the Department of Horticulture at Michigan State University, stated to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, for the 83rd Congress of the United States that when “we apply fertilizer nutrient materials to the above ground growing portion of the plant. We have seen that materials are absorbed by the plant and move rather freely in the plant.  The amounts may at first seem relatively small, but to offset this handicap, the efficiency is high.  In fact, this is the most efficient method of applying fertilizer to plants that we have yet discovered.  If we apply these materials to the leaves in soluble forms, as much as 95 percent of what is applied may be used by the plant. If we apply a similar amount to the soil, we find about 10 percent of it to be used.”

29,Yellow Pine Flooring,,Allensville,"Dreaming of affordable wood flooring? One of our most economical options is our Southern Yellow Pine tongue and groove flooring. We currently have a good inventory of 1x6. This is a common grade knotty yellow pine and will have a tremendous amount of beautiful character to it, as you can see in the pictures of the wood and our customers' homes. We can supply small projects and whole houses. 

Common Grade (#3) Southern Yellow Pine Flooring Pricing

The yellow pine is priced at $1.85 per sq ft for unopened packs and $1.95 if we have to split the packs. Again, pack sizes vary (as small as 400 sq ft to as large as 2,000 sq ft). These packs typically have one or two lengths in them. An unopened pack of 1,000 sq ft would cost $1,850 plus tax.

Linear foot price- $.76 per linear foot for 1x6 yellow pine flooring

We love to see your projects come to life and frequently share pictures of our customers' projects on Facebook. Check out our page (http://facebook.com/KentuckyLumber) for more pictures, our customers' ratings, and more information!
